# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmed Ashraf

Laravel Backend Developer focused on building real-world, scalable systems.
I care deeply about clean architecture, maintainable code, and understanding *why* things work — not just *how*.


## 🧠 About Me

- Backend Developer specialized in **PHP & Laravel**
- Building and continuously improving a real-world **Ecommerce / POS-like system**
- Focused on core software engineering concepts and backend architecture
- Daily learner with a strong interest in performance, security, and clean code


## 🏗 How I Think About Software

I approach backend development as a system, not just a set of features:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Business logic before UI
- Security and performance as first-class concerns
- Continuous refactoring as the system grows


## 🧩 Laravel Experience

I work deeply with Laravel internals and ecosystem, including:
- Authentication & Authorization (Sanctum, Fortify, Policies, Multi-Guard, 2FA)
- Queues, Jobs, Events & Observers
- Notifications (Mail, Database, Broadcast)
- Eloquent ORM & Polymorphic Relations
- RESTful APIs & API Resources
- Scopes, Soft Deletes, and Query Optimization


## 🧱 Architecture & Patterns

- Repository Pattern & Contract Binding
- Clean, maintainable code practices
- Decoupled services & reusable components
- Design decisions driven by real use cases


## ⚡ Realtime & Integrations

- Stripe payment gateway with webhooks
- Currency conversion API with caching & localization
- Realtime delivery tracking using Pusher broadcasting


## 🛠 Tech Stack

PHP • Laravel • MySQL • Docker • Git • Stripe • Pusher

## 🚀 Currently

Actively developing my main project, refining architecture, and exploring deeper backend and system design concepts.
